                    Hello. My name is Adam Hayward. I recently moved from Dallas, Texas to Anchorage, Alaska. I
                    relocated to Anchorage to be near family, and of course, for adventures in this huge
                    playground that
                    is America's last frontier.
                    <br>
                    Prior to moving, I spent the last 8 years as a manager with AT&T, supervising
                    a team of up to 25 technitians. While I enjoyed my ride at AT&T, I was seeking both a
                    lifestyle change and a career change. I learned from my experiences at AT&T, after being
                    exposed to
                    Lean and
                    Agile methodologies, that something in the Information Management (technology) field would
                    be a good
                    fit for me. After doing a lot of research, I resigned from my position and currently have
                    the
                    luxury of focusing on completing a Full Stack Certificate though SMU.

                    Although I am new to programming, I’ve been told more than once in the last few years, that
                    I was
                    born for problem solving. I am starting to agree as I am enjoying the program
                    emensely, challenges and all. Programmers I know have told me that after working hard –
                    frustration
                    and all – that solving the problems enherent to coding, is a rush you rarlely get day-to-day
                    in
                    other professions. I’m already hooked.
